## Service Worker Prototype

### Description
I wanted to learn more about service workers and how they could be implemented within a React app, so I created this project.


### Commands
I used [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to get this thing up and going quickly, so if you wanted to run this locally, you'll  need to first install it using

`npm install -g create-react-app`

and then run one of the following commands (as output by `create-react-app`):

`npm start` -> Starts the development server.

`npm run build` -> Bundles the app into static files for production.

`npm test` -> Starts the test runner.
